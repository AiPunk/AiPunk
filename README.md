# 👋 Hi, I’m Johannes the AIPunk

I’m an **AI Engineer & Data Scientist** with experience at IBM, KPMG, and Apheris.  
My professional focus lies at the intersection of **machine learning, data engineering, and MLOps**, building production-grade AI systems that deliver measurable impact. But I also love to play around with AI for fun, like creating my home automation and bots, talking to me as well as creating AI images and videos with my own set of tools

### 🚀 What I Work On
- **Machine Learning Engineering:** Model design, training pipelines, and deployment (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn)
- **Data Science & Analytics:** Data exploration, visualization, and storytelling with data
- **MLOps:** CI/CD for ML, experiment tracking, model monitoring
- **Privacy-Preserving ML:** Federated learning and data governance (experience from Apheris)
- **Home Automation:** My own personal assistants, installed on the edge
- **AI Image, Music and Video Creation:** Tailored for my nerdy hobbys, like Pen and Paper and Heavy Metal
