# 👋 Hi, I’m Johannes Forster (@AiPunk)

I’m an experienced **AI Developer & Data Scientist**, passionate about bridging **machine learning**, **data engineering**, and **intelligent automation** — from enterprise-scale pipelines to creative AI projects.

I’ve worked with global companies like **IBM** and **KPMG**, as well as the startup **Apheris**, specializing in:
- Applied **Machine Learning & MLOps**
- **Federated Learning** & Data Privacy
- **Generative AI** (Video, Music, and Text)
- **Data Factory / ETL Design**
- **Edge AI & Home Automation**
